# myDS_course

this is a test to see how easy it is to create a README file. This is my first time but it looks reasonably strait forward 

I am starting with data from the following Kaggle Public dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/loan-defaulter

This looks like a well organized data set. 

There are 3 files in this data set. 

1) a file describing the column names and descriptions
2) the main data showing contract information on a set of over 300K contracts with a target variable indicating whether or not a particular customer was classified as having trouble paying back a loan along with many feature variables.
3) a file with information about past applications for customers.
