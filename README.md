# Data Science Project #1 - Investigating a Financial Data Set of Loans.

The Dataset: 
For this project, I as using a public dataset from Kaggle located here: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/loan-defaulter

This looks like a well organized data set with many features. This, combined with the type of data (financial) made it interesting to me. 

There are 3 files in this data set:
1) a file describing the column names and descriptions
2) the main data showing contract information on a set of over 300K contracts with a target variable indicating whether or not a particular customer was classified as having trouble paying back a loan along with many feature variables.
3) a file with information about past applications for customers.

Looking at the data I asked a few questions: 
1) what is the percent of contracts that defaulted?
2) Does the amount of the load relative to a party's income (whether an individual or corporate entity) have an effect on the default rate?
3) pending

To answer these questions, I am utilizing python to do machine learning. 

What did I learn? 
I will get back to this in the near future as I tidy up my code.
